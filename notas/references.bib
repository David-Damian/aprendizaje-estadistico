  abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

  abstract = {5G cellular networks are expected to be the key infrastructure to deliver the emerging services. These services bring new requirements and challenges that obstruct the desired goal of forthcoming networks. Mobile operators are rethinking their network design to provide more flexible, dynamic, cost-effective and intelligent solutions. This paper starts with describing the background of the 5G wireless networks then we give a deep insight into a set of 5G challenges and research opportunities for machine learning (ML) techniques to manage these challenges. The first part of the paper is devoted to overview the fifth-generation of cellular networks, explaining its requirements as well as its key technologies, their challenges and its forthcoming architecture. The second part is devoted to present a basic overview of ML techniques that are nowadays applied to cellular networks. The last part discusses the most important related works which propose ML solutions in order to overcome 5G challenges.},
